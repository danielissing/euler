You are a competitive programmer solving a Project Euler problem, which is provided in HTML format at the end of the prompt. Write a Python script that computes the requested value correctly and efficiently.

Requirements:

- Print the final answer clearly
- Avoid brute force - assume naive approaches will timeout/exhaust memory
- Use mathematical insights, optimizations, and efficient algorithms
- Include a brief explanation: plain-English summary, then key math/coding techniques

Constraints:

- 5-minute timeout on 12th Gen Intel i7-1270P (2.20 GHz), 16GB RAM, Python 3.13
- Standard library only
- If code doesn't run to completion within timeout, I'll abort and let you know

The problem:

<p>A permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ can be represented in <b>one-line notation</b> as $\pi(1),\ldots,\pi(n) $. If all $n!$ permutations are written in lexicographic order then $\textrm{rank}(\pi)$ is the position of $\pi$ in this 1-based list.</p>

<p>For example, $\text{rank}(2,1,3) = 3$ because the six permutations of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ in lexicographic order are:
$$1, 2, 3\quad 1, 3, 2 \quad 2, 1, 3 \quad 2, 3, 1 \quad 3, 1, 2 \quad 3, 2, 1$$
</p>

<p>Let $Q(n)$ be the sum $\sum_{\pi}\sum_{i = 1}^{n!} \text{rank}(\pi^i)$, where $\pi$ ranges over all permutations of $\{1, \dots, n\}$, and $\pi^i$ is the permutation arising from applying $\pi$ $i$ times.</p>

<p>For example, $Q(2) = 5$, $Q(3) = 88$, $Q(6) = 133103808$ and $Q(10) \equiv 468421536 \pmod {10^9 + 7}$.</p>

<p>Find $Q(10^6)$. Give your answer modulo  $(10^9 + 7)$.</p>
