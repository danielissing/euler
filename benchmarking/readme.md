## List of selected problems

In this directory, you'll find all the solutions generated by three different LLMs for increasingly difficult [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. Not all of these solutions are correct (see table below for details), but they're shared here to get a sense of what the models were trying to do.

All problems selected for this competition were uploaded after May 2022 (problem number >800). I also excluded problems for which solutions already existed (partial or complete) in this relatively exhaustive [repo](https://www.ivl-projecteuler.com/home). Other than ensuring different levels of difficulty, I tried to pick problems from a variety of topics (geometry, algebra, combinatorics etc).

The final selection of problems is below:

| Difficulty | Problem |
|------------|---------|
| 5% | [Exhausting a Colour](https://projecteuler.net/problem=938) |
| 10% | [Larger Digit Permutation](https://projecteuler.net/problem=862) |
| 20% | [XOR-Equation A](https://projecteuler.net/problem=877) |
| 30% | [Beans in Bowls](https://projecteuler.net/problem=839) |
| 40% | [Pisano Periods 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=854) |
| 50% | [Pythagorean Triple Occurrence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=827) |
| 60% | [Beautiful Graphs](https://projecteuler.net/problem=857) |
| 70% | [Rational Blancmange](https://projecteuler.net/problem=889) |
| 80% | [Irregular Star Polygons](https://projecteuler.net/problem=842) |
| 90% | [Total Permutation Powers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=903) |
| 100% | [Dynamical Polynomials](https://projecteuler.net/problem=812) |

## Performance of AI Models on Project Euler Problems

I tested the most powerful (as of summer 2025) AI models created by three of the main players in the field - Anthropic, Google and OpenAI. Each time, I provided them with the prompt that can be found in the problem subdirectories. Models hat two chances to find the solution, and the only feedback I provided was (a) whether the answer was correct and (b) any console output generated while running the script.

The difference in performance was stark:

### Legend
- ✅ **Succeeded** = Correct solution and code ran successfully  
- ❌ **Eliminated** = Both attempts failed
- ⚠️ **Partial/Mixed** = First attempt failed
- **Thinking time (in parantheses)** = How long the model spent “working” before producing the solution
