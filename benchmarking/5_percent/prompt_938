You are a competitive programmer solving a Project Euler problem, which is provided in HTML format at the end of the prompt. Write a Python script that computes the requested value correctly and efficiently.

Requirements:

- Print the final answer clearly
- Avoid brute force - assume naive approaches will timeout/exhaust memory
- Use mathematical insights, optimizations, and efficient algorithms
- Include a brief explanation: plain-English summary, then key math/coding techniques

Your code will be judged solely on correctness. You get two attempts - if wrong, you'll only see "incorrect" and any console output.

The problem:

<p>
A deck of cards contains $R$ red cards and $B$ black cards.<br>
A card is chosen uniformly randomly from the deck and removed. A second card is then chosen uniformly randomly from the cards remaining and removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If both cards are red, they are discarded.</li>
<li>
If both cards are black, they are both put back in the deck.</li>
<li>
If they are different colours, the red card is put back in the deck and the black card is discarded.</li></ul>
<p>
Play ends when all the remaining cards in the deck are the same colour and let $P(R,B)$ be the probability that this colour is black. </p>
<p>
You are given $P(2,2) = 0.4666666667$, $P(10,9) = 0.4118903397$ and $P(34,25) = 0.3665688069$.</p>
<p>
Find $P(24690,12345)$. Give your answer with 10 digits after the decimal point.</p>
